# Dom Selector

## Version: 1.1.0

Get `NodeName`, `classList`, and `id` alongwith `width`, `height`, `display`, `padding`, `margin` and `border` of elements without opening Console.

## Usage

```html
<!-- Use Development CDN -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shivamdevs/dom-selector@latest/selector.js" defer></script>
<!-- or Use Production CDN -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shivamdevs/dom-selector@latest/selector.min.js" defer></script>
```

> Adding `defer` can help delay **Dom-Selector** loading, preventing it from increasing page load time.

## Limitation

* Restricted to top window only
* Can't distinguish between before and after pseudo-elements
